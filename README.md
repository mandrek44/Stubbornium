# Stubbornium

Stubbornium is a .NET wrapper for Selenium API that enables you to write robust and stable test for complex sites.

Do your test runs sometimes fail because some element was missing? Do you have `Thread.Sleep` call in your tests? Do you insert code for waiting for ajax completion in hope it will make test more stable?

If yes then Stubbornium will give you a clean and simple interface for writing tests without worrying about all those aspects. 

## Install
